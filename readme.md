This is just a little library for ICMP I implemented in D to demonstrate my
knowledge of ICMP. It is in no way production ready. I also had to create
a small Internet Protocol library to make it work, since ICMP is contingent
upon IP.

While this library is in poor state at the moment, I do expect to return to
it when I finish my ASN.1 Library.
